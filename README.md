**KiwiCare** is a full-stack volunteer help platform that enables users to request assistance, volunteers to offer availability, and admins to manage the entire system. The platform is built with:

- **Frontend:** React.js + Tailwind CSS
- **Backend:** Spring Boot + Spring Security + JWT
- **Database:** MySQL-compatible

The application supports **role-based dashboards** with different capabilities for **Users**, **Volunteers**, and **Admins**.
